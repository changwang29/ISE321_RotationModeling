Need to convert the model result to a csv file first and then import into the output part. 

# output list is where we store the list of x variables when it's equal to 1
output = []
for v in m.getVars():
    if v.x == 1: # When assign the resident to this rotation in the block 
        # print('%s %g' % (v.varName,v.x))
        print(v.varName) 
        # varName's type is String. We need to strip unnecessary parts and store in the list 
        output.append(re.split(',+', v.varName.strip(' x[]')))


# Store everything in a table group by resident name
num = np.array(output)
sch = pd.DataFrame(num, columns=['Resident','Rotation','Block'])

# Export as csv file 
sch.to_csv('output_data.csv', index = False)
